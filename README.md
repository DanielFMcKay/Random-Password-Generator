# Random-Password-Generator

* This password generator is for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, challenge assignment for Week 3.

* The generator will create a randomized password according to a series of prompts, as per the assignment.

* The prompts are for a length of between 8 and 128 characters, and whether the user wishes to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

* After each prompt is selected or rejected, the user's choice will be validated

* The password will then be displayed in the text field.

* There is also an option to copy the text. A button has been included for that as well. Once copied, confirmation of this is displayed.
