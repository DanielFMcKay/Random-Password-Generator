### Overview

* This password generator is for the edX Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp as offered through UC Berkeley continuing education, and is the challenge assignment for Week 3.

* The generator will create a randomized password according to a series of prompts, as per the assignment.

* The prompts are for a length of between 8 and 128 characters, and whether the user wishes to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

* After each prompt is selected or rejected, the user's choice will be validated

* The password will then be displayed in the text field.

* There is also an option to copy the text. A button has been included for that as well. Once copied, confirmation of this is displayed.

### Live Site

* The live site is deployed https://danielfmckay.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/
